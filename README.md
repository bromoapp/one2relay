# One2relay

This is a simple **WebRTC** project, where you can broadcast a webcam video in one browser (as an anchor) to the 2nd browser (as an audience), than to the 3rd browser. The difference with one2many project is that the 3rd browser receives its stream from the 2nd (the 2nd browser relays the stream from the anchor to the rd). If we open the forth browser to view the anchor, the 3rd will relay the stream from the 2nd to 4th, and so on.

This project is part of a continues learning on **WebRTC**.
